C File I/O

This repository contains information and exercises related to file input/output (I/O) in the C programming language.



Topics

File descriptors

open() function

close() function

read() function

write() function

dprintf() function

Commands

open(): The open() function is used to open a file in the file system and return a file descriptor that can be used to access the file. The file descriptor is an integer value that represents the file and is used in other file I/O functions.



close(): The close() function is used to close a file and release any resources associated with it. It takes the file descriptor as an argument and returns 0 on success and -1 on error.



read(): The read() function is used to read data from a file. It takes the file descriptor, a buffer to store the data, and the number of bytes to read as arguments, and returns the number of bytes actually read.



write(): The write() function is used to write data to a file. It takes the file descriptor, a buffer containing the data to write, and the number of bytes to write as arguments, and returns the number of bytes actually written.



dprintf(): The dprintf() function is similar to the printf() function, but writes to a file instead of to the standard output. It takes the file descriptor, a format string, and arguments for the format string, and returns the number of characters written.



Usage

To compile the exercises in this repository, use the following command:



Copy code

gcc filename.c -o outputfile

And then run the output file using:



bash

Copy code

./outputfile
