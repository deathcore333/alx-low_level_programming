The first outlook on recursion. a function that calls itself replacing the loop statements and helps in solving complex mathematical problems
recursion works with functions with base case otherwise it may run into an infinfinite recursion where the function does not terminate after a finite number of recursive calls
file one - contains a function that prints a string followed by a a new line
file two - a function that prints a string in reverse
file three - function that returns the length of a string
file four - function that returns the factorial of a given number
file five - function that returns the value of x raised to power y
file six - returns the natural square root of a number
file seven - function that returns 1 for prime numbers 0 otherwise
file eight - function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome
file nine - function that compares two strings and returns 1 if they are identical, 0 otherwise
