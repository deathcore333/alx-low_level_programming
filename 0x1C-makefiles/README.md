Introduction
Makefile is a tool used for building and managing projects. It uses a set of directives to automate the compilation process of a project. The Makefile in this repository is a sample file that can be used as a reference to create your own Makefile.

Getting Started
To use the sample Makefile in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<username>/0x1C-makefiles.git
Change to the directory containing the Makefile:

cd 0x1C-makefiles
Run the following command to build the project:
go
Copy code
make
Run the following command to clean up the build:
go
Copy code
make clean
Build Process
The Makefile in this repository is a simple example that demonstrates how to use Makefile directives to automate the build process of a project. The Makefile has two main directives, all and clean.

The all directive is used to build the project. When the make command is executed, the all directive is called, which compiles the source code and generates an executable file.

The clean directive is used to remove any files generated during the build process. When the make clean command is executed, the clean directive is called, which removes the executable file and any object files generated during the build process.

The Makefile also includes variables that can be used to customize the build process. For example, the CC variable specifies the compiler to be used, and the CFLAGS variable specifies the compiler flags to be used during compilation.

Customizing the Build Process
To customize the build process, you can modify the variables in the Makefile to suit your requirements. For example, if you want to use a different compiler, you can change the value of the CC variable. Similarly, if you want to use different compiler flags, you can modify the value of the CFLAGS variable.

You can also add additional directives to the Makefile to perform other tasks, such as generating documentation or running tests.
